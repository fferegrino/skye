Bus to Broadford
    Last bus to Broadford
    Driver gave us enough motivation to start hitchhiking
    
Attempt to walk to Kyle of Lochalsh
    We were crazy thinking that we were going to make it walking until Kyle of Lochalsh
    
Airbnb lady
    Can't remember that lady's name
    Her house creeped me out a bit with the pictures of her sons
   
Indian family
    From Hyderabad
    They only stopped because they thought Lorraine was from India
    Our first official ride
    "Are you travelling alone?"
    Antonio was like a piece of furniture there
    
Sari skirt lady
    Not a strong scottish accend since she had been living outside the country
    She pointed out that she was wearing a **VERY** expensive sari skirt she bought from Lele or something with a similar name
    She said she gives ride to a lot of hitchhikers
    
Dirty car guy
    asked us if we just met in the bus
    do you remember anything else? I don't. hahaha
    went a bit off his way to take us near our destination
    mentioned something about a wall between Scotland and England in the Roman empire era

Kayak guy
    was really nice
    He had seen us before hitchhiking and was looking for us
    gave lot of tips
    suggested that we buy some insect repellant to prevent midge bites
    dropped us off at dunvegan in front of a store to buy stuff
    again picked us up and dropped us on the way to Glendale

French couple
    They were amazing - moved all their stuff in the back seat to the trunk to make space for us
    The guy has travelled a lot - backpacked all the cities in Mexico
    probably know Mexico better than my Mexican guy :P
    Amazed at the blackface sheeps

Welsh couple
    Old couple
    we shared seats with the little cute dogs even though it really freaked me out ;)
    they have travelled several times to the skye
    they offered to drive us back if we were leaving at the same time as them
    and they actually did
    the lady sat in the back seat since I looked really freaked out  when I sat with the dogs. haha

Scottish old man
    Who has a son who told them that Data Science is a growing field
    He quit his job in the oil and gas field (off shore) after working there for 20 years
    was boring apparently and was probably missing his wife :P
    Spoke briefly about analytics, facebook, cambridge analytica etc etc
    Lorraine sat in the trunk and the guy noticed that
    Offered to pick us up again if he met us again
    Oh yeah. And he said to Antonio that â€œI thought that the gentleman will go in the trunk :P"
    So going forward Lorraine is going to respect the Mexican tradition and let Antonio sit in the trunk (ALWAYS).. Hahahah

Scottish couple
    Looked like very serious guys. haha :D
    I think they weren't that old...
    Offered to drive us until Dunvegan castle (even though we were not so sure about it)

Three friends ride
    really cool young group. two girls and a guy
    the girl is living in glasgow after she did her undergrad and masters in glasgow university (but Lorraine does not believe this story)
    it was a short ride to coral beach
    we talked about how we met
    they did hiking all the way from north east of skye to mann of storr
    and they were apparently all exhausted
    they also did hitchikking like us few days ago. haha

Holland family
    wife husband and a little cute girl (who kept smiling) and little boy (who was probably wondering why the hell we were in their car ;))
    asked about our course and how we met
    when I said that I'm from India the little girl said tht she's also from India and I thought that she was kidding
    well.. she actually wasnt
    her mom told that the kid was born in Bombay when she was working there for a couple of years.
    :)
    they dropped us off at dunvegan in front of a cafe and the guy said that we would get nice masala chai there
    following the ancient mexican tradition, Antonio sat on the floor of the van

"Friends"
    German guy and spanish girl
    seemed like a couple but they didn;t mention anything about it
    they said that they were travelling together since they were friends and that they met in university thanks to that erasmus program
    They dropped us off at the divide between Big and Portree and we had to walk about 5 miles to Portree 
    Omg.. I would say thatâ€™s the most risky thing I have ever done in my life; but as they say â€œNo risk, no reward". And would never want to do it again ðŸ˜ž

Rich couple in the Fancy car
    Lorraine's theory that "the people in fancy cars wouldn't give a ride" was thus proved falsifiable ;)
    The couple met in university of stirling
    They were really really nice
    They were driving from Portree to Broadford(after visiting their daughter in Portree) and drove us all the way to Kyle of Lochalsh
    the lady contacted her friend and let us know that the last train to inverness already left from the kyle of lochalsh
    they also suggested that we can stay in Kyleakin
    They have been living in skye for really long
    saw amazing sunset on the way from Broadford to Kyle with a full moon on the other side
    one of the amazing sceneries I have ever seen ðŸ™‚
