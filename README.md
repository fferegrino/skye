# skye  

This *interactive* map was created as attempt to document my adventurous holidays to the Isle of Skye. 

It takes a json file, [just like this](https://fferegrino.github.io/skye/trip.json) and draws all the details on the map. 

The default display is my amazing (and kind of dangerous) trip to Skye with Lorraine (thanks Lorraine!), but you can specify a different trip through the parameter `trip` in the URL.

## Json file  
The JSON file necessary for the map to work is described as:

TODO: Define schema...
